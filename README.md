# Introduction

Hi there! If you don't know me, my name is Rana Khalil and I go by the twitter handle [**@rana\_\_khalil**](https://twitter.com/rana__khalil). I'm currently working on getting the Offensive Security Web Expert \(OSWE\) certification.

My primary source of preparation is the AWAE course material and labs. However, as a secondary source of preapartion, I'm also working on [**TJ\_Null's list of Hack The Box OSWE-like VMs**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#) shown in the below image. As I go through the machines, I will write writeups/blogs on how to solve each box on [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@ranakhalil101). These writeups are going to be backed up on this github repository. 

Hope you enjoy the writeups and feel free to get in touch with me if you have any questions / suggestions!
